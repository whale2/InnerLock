	description = After discovering the need to hold moving sections of spacecraft in place during long-term missions, MSI teamed up with Blue Whale to create the Lock family of Utilitron parts! Unlike a traditional docking port, this connector can join with others on the same or different craft without merging the craft together. It also features "fingers" to allow for alignment at 90 degree angles. This is the Pro version intended for use as an attachment point on spacecraft and stations.
