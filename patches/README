Placing this patch under GameData would result in:

- Stock Cargo bays becoming switchable - should they generate collisions to all other parts. Beware of part clipping!
- Stock Trusses becoming collideably to each other only

Make your own patches in order to enable collisions on any other parts.

isSwitchable parameter activates a collision switch in Editor
isPermalock paramter activates collisions for this part with: a) part, that switched to be collideable in Editor and b) to other part with permalock
